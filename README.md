CHIJ STC Hockey Tracker
Empowering Young Athletes with Smart Training Habits
The Challenge
New hockey players often face a common problem: they don't know how much training is enough—or too much. Without proper guidance, young athletes may:

Overtrain and risk injuries
Skip rest days, leading to burnout
Lack visibility on their weekly progress
Miss important recovery periods that are essential for muscle growth and skill development
The Solution
CHIJ STC Hockey Tracker is a simple, intuitive mobile app designed specifically for student athletes to:

✅ Track Training Sessions — Log matches, drills, fitness, strength, and recovery activities with just a few taps

✅ Set Weekly Goals — Establish a target training duration each week and monitor progress with visual indicators

✅ Monitor Rest & Recovery — See how many rest days have been taken, track active recovery sessions, and receive personalised insights based on training patterns

✅ Prevent Overtraining — Get smart alerts when consecutive training days are too high or when the training load is unbalanced

✅ View Historical Progress — Review past weeks and months to understand training consistency and goal achievement over time

Why This Matters for New Players
Young athletes are eager and enthusiastic—but they often lack the experience to pace themselves. This app teaches them:

Balance — Understanding that rest is just as important as training
Consistency — Building sustainable habits rather than sporadic intense sessions
Self-Awareness — Recognising their own training patterns and adjusting accordingly
Injury Prevention — Learning early that overtraining leads to setbacks, not progress
